# SpeedyLauncher

An educational game for primary and middle school students to practice their math skills.

- I used WPF with C# and XAML to develop the game.
- After the user chooses what math operations they want, the game asks them random math questions to help them practice their math.
- There is also a point system in the game; you get one point for each right answer, and you lose a point for 3 wrong answers.
- As of now there are only 2 cat characters in the game.
